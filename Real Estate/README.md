## Dataset
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle [Real Estate Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction) and contains various features related to properties, such as:
- Transaction date
- House age
- Distance to the nearest MRT station
- Number of convenience stores
- Latitude and longitude
- Price per unit area

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and placed in the correct directory.
2. Run the main script to train the neural network model and make predictions:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Model Architecture
The neural network architecture consists of:
- Input Layer
- Hidden Layers (with activation functions)
- Output Layer (predicting the price)

The model is compiled using Mean Squared Error as the loss function and an optimizer of choice (e.g., Adam).

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score. Visualizations of predicted vs. actual prices are also provided.
