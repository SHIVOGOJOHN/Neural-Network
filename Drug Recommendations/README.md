# Drug Classification Model

This project implements a neural network to predict the type of drug recommended for a patient based on demographic and medical data. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model classifies drugs based on features like age, sex, blood pressure (BP), and cholesterol levels. 

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
This project builds a classification model to predict the correct drug type for a given patient using demographic and medical details. The model is trained to distinguish between multiple drug classes and is designed to handle both numerical and categorical features. 

## ðŸ’¡ About Dataset
- Drug dataset; https://github.com/SHIVOGOJOHN/Neural-Network/blob/main/Drug%20Recommendations/drug.csv
- Prediction dataset; https://github.com/SHIVOGOJOHN/Neural-Network/blob/main/Drug%20Recommendations/single_row_sample.csv
  
The dataset used in this project, `drug.csv`, contains the following columns:
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient (`F` for Female, `M` for Male).
- **BP**: Blood pressure level (`HIGH`, `NORMAL`, `LOW`).
- **Cholesterol**: Cholesterol level (`HIGH`, `NORMAL`).
- **Na_to_K**: Sodium-to-potassium ratio in blood.
- **Drug**: Target variable indicating the drug type prescribed.
