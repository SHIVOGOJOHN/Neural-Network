# ðŸ“Š Bank Marketing Campaign 

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the well-known Bank Marketing dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this project is to determine whether or not a customer subscribes to term deposit(yes/no) using a neural network

## ðŸ’¡ Insights and Objectives
This project aims to analyze the bank marketing data and uncover patterns that can assist in optimizing future marketing campaigns. Some of the key objectives include:

- Determine potential client clusters most likely to subscribe to a term deposit.
- Explore client characteristics (age, job, education, balance, etc.) that lead to higher term deposit subscriptions.
- Identify correlations between various factors (e.g., housing loans, previous campaign success) and term deposit outcomes.

## ðŸ’¡ About Dataset
- Bank dataset; https://github.com/SHIVOGOJOHN/Neural-Network/blob/main/bank.csv
- Prediction dataset; https://github.com/SHIVOGOJOHN/Neural-Network/blob/main/sample_data.csv
  
### 1.Bank Client Data
- age: Client's age (numeric)
-  job: Client's occupation (e.g., 'admin.', 'technician', 'student')
- marital: Marital status (e.g., 'single', 'married')
- education: Education level (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- default: Whether the client has credit in default
- housing: Whether the client has a housing loan
- loan: Whether the client has a personal loan
- balance: Current account balance (numeric)
### 2.Last Contact Information (Campaign-related)
- contact: Type of communication used (cellular or telephone)
- month: Month of the last contact (e.g., 'jan', 'feb')
- day: Day of the week when the last contact was made
- duration: Duration of the last call (in seconds)
### 3.Other Campaign Data
- campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign for each client
- pdays: Number of days since the client was last contacted (999 if not contacted before)
- previous: Number of contacts made before this campaign
- poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign (failure, success, nonexistent)
### 4. Output variable (desired target):
- y: has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
